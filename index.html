			<h1>Student Veterans Survey</h1>
			<p>Matriculating back into civilian society takes a lot of courage. Student veterans, courageous beyond their call of duty and looking to take on their next endeavors, often matriculate into college to finish their degrees. While some do succeed, a large number of these veterans are unfortunately dropping out of college without completing their degree. Attrition rates in some colleges can reach as high as 88%. Considering how these veterans previously completed their military service with distinction and honor, we would like to determine how we can best help student veterans in their next phase of life and what roadblocks prevent them from completing their degrees.</p>
			<p>Our survey researches the variety of issues capable of preventing student veterans from completing their baccalaureate degrees. We seek to help remove the obstacles student veterans nationwide face. The economic benefits to helping student veterans transition and become productive, active and influential members of society are numerous, both for the veterans directly influenced and the country.</p>
